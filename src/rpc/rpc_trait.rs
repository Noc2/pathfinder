//! Definition of JSON-RPC endpoints.
//!
//! The trait [RpcApiServer] describes the RPC API methods served by the node.
//! The methods are taken from [the Starknet operator API spec](https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-adrs/blob/master/api/starknet_operator_api_openrpc.json).
//! Any extensions to the above spec are explicitly marked in the documentation.
